# Pinball Game - Caleb Wiebolt

Below is the writeup for my pinball game. It was created in Unity for my Animation and Planning in Games class. All the graded features that I attempted can be found below. To look at the source code or a pre built executable click the button below.

### Feature List

| Feature                           | Description       | TimeCode |
|:-------------                     |:------------------|:------|
| Basic Pinball Dynamics            | Simple, physically accurate simulation of the ball as it moves and bounces | The whole video  |
| Multiple Balls Interacting        | Multiple balls on screen at the same time interacting with each other | 1:37-2:04   |
| Circular Obstacles                | I implemented circular objects for the balls to bounce off of. | 0:43-0:51  |
| Line Segment Obstacles            | The use of line segments/polygons, used on the upper border and the border by the flippers. | 0:53-0:59  |
| Plunger/Launcher to shoot balls   | I implemented a plunger that is controlled by the space bar to launch balls into the scene | 0:02-0:10  |
| Textured Background               | I textured the background of the pinball table with a wood texture | The whole video  |
| Textured Obstacles                | I textured various obstacles, especially the circular bumpers with textures depending on their point value. | The whole video  |
| Reactive Obstacles                | When a pinball hits one of the point giving bumpers the bumper will flash. | 1:12-1:17  |
| Score Display                     | The current score is displayed graphically on screen and updates as scoring bumpers are hit | The whole video  |
| Pinball Game                      | Both flippers work independently with the left and right mouse buttons and balls colliding off of the flippers naturally. To start the game you press the start button. Your goal is to hit as many of the scoring bumpers as possible. You have a limited number of balls you can launch onto the screen and once they are gone it is game over. | 0:55-1:36  |

## Difficulties Encountered
Building this game was a fun challenge. No matter how many times I seem to write collision code it is always a finicky and messy thing to get working cleanly. One of the main challenges I ran into while coding this project was my tendency to indulge in scope creep. This was especially true when it came to things like OOP design practices. For the collision system especially, I started with a very generalized, nicely designed OOP version that just didn't work. It could have worked but I realized as I was writing it how much time I was spending writing code that I would never need for this project. Code that, while well designed, was just making it harder for me to troubleshoot what was happening in this small game. I ended up with a more tailored approach to design for this game. Is it wonderfully designed with long-term scalability in mind, no. Does it fit this application well without being unwieldy or restrictive, yes. My main takeaway is to start by solving the problem in front of you and make it work before you make it perfect.
